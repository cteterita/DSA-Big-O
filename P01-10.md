## 1. What is the Big O for this?
1) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog, preferably of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You stand up and yell out, who here has a golden retriever and would like to be a playdate for my golden. Someone yells - "I do, be happy to bring him over"

O(1) - time is independent of how many people are in the room

2) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog who is of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You start with the first person and ask him if he has a golden retriever. He says no, then you ask the next person, and the next, and the next until you find someone who has a golden or there is no one else to ask.

O(n) - time is linearly dependent on how many people are in the room

## 2. Even or odd
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

```js
function isEven(value) {
    if (value % 2 === 0) {
        return true;
    }
    else
        return false;
    }
}
```
O(1) - there's no looping, so there's just one if statement to evluate regardless of the size of `value`

## 3. Are you here?
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

```js
function areYouHere(arr1, arr2) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        const el1 = arr1[i];
        for (let j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
            const el2 = arr2[j];
            if (el1 === el2) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
O(n^2) - you're looping through arr.length times inside a loop that's called arr.length times- hence, arr.length squared.

## 4. Doubler
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

```js
function doubleArrayValues(array) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        array[i] *= 2;
    }
    return array;
}
```
O(n) - you loop through exactly array.length times with no further nesting, so time is linearly dependent on the size of the array.

## 5. Naive search
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

```js
function naiveSearch(array, item) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] === item) {
            return i;
        }
    }
}
```
O(n) - you loop through array.length times with no nesting.

## 6. Creating pairs:
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

```js
function createPairs(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for(let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
            console.log(arr[i] + ", " +  arr[j] );
        }
    }
}
```
O(n^2) - you loop through arr.length within a loop of arr.length, hence arr.length squared

## 7. Compute the sequence
What does the following algorithm do? What is its runtime complexity? Explain your answer

```js
function compute(num) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {

        if (i === 1) {
            result.push(0);
        }
        else if (i === 2) {
            result.push(1);
        }
        else {
            result.push(result[i - 2] + result[i - 3]);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```
It prints the Fibonnacci sequence in O(n) time, because there is exactly one loop repeated num times.

## 8. An efficient search
In this example, we return to the problem of searching using a more sophisticated approach than in naive search, above. Assume that the input array is always sorted. What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

```js
function efficientSearch(array, item) {
    let minIndex = 0;
    let maxIndex = array.length - 1;
    let currentIndex;
    let currentElement;

    while (minIndex <= maxIndex) {
        currentIndex = Math.floor((minIndex + maxIndex) / 2);
        currentElement = array[currentIndex];

        if (currentElement < item) {
            minIndex = currentIndex + 1;
        }
        else if (currentElement > item) {
            maxIndex = currentIndex - 1;
        }
        else {
            return currentIndex;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```
O(log(n)) - the initial search is of array.length, but it is halved in every while loop.

## 9. Random element
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

```js
function findRandomElement(arr) {
    return arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];
}
```
O(1) - the return value is evaluated once, and does not depend on arr.length.

## 10. What Am I?
What does the following algorithm do? What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

```js
function isWhat(n) {
    if (n < 2 || n % 1 !== 0) {
        return false;
    }
    for (let i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
        if (n % i === 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
It prints whether a number is prime. It runs in O(n) time since it loops n-1 times.
